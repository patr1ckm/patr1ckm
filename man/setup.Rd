\usage{
setup(object, dir = "", .reps = 1, .chunks = 1, .mc.cores = 1,
  .verbose = 1, .script.name = "doone.R")
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{gapply object}

\item{dir}{directory name relative to the current working directory, ends in '/'}

\item{.reps}{total number of replications for each condition}

\item{.chunks}{split \code{.reps} across this many nodes (see details)}

\item{.mc.cores}{number of cores used to run replications in parallel}

\item{.verbose}{verbose level}

\item{.script.name}{name of script}
}
\description{
setup sge simulation
}
\details{
The replications performed per chunk is computed as \code{ceiling(.reps/.chunks)}, which
will produce more total replications than requested if \code{.reps} is not evenly divisible by \code{.chunks}
}
